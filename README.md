# Boolean Modeling of Microbial Interactions through Threshold-Optimized Logic Regression.

All the R code

## Description

The purpose of this project is to model how microbial interactions in conjunction with their relative abundances are linked to infections/diseases. Applied logic regression to capture Boolean relationships among microbial taxa, and developed a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize microbe-specific abundance thresholds contributing to the model.
